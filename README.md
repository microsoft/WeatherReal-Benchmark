# WeatherReal: An observation benchmark for weather forecasting

Welcome to the official GitHub repository and leaderboard page for the WeatherReal weather forecasting benchmark!
This repository includes code for running the evaluation of weather forecasting models on the WeatherReal benchmark dataset, 
as well as links to the LFS storage for the data files.
If you would like to contribute a model evaluation result to this page, please open an Issue with the tag "Submission".

## Why WeatherReal?

Weather forecasting is a critical application for many scenarios, including disaster preparedness, agriculture, energy, 
and day-to-day life. Recent advances in AI applications for weather forecasting have demonstrated enourmous potential, 
with models like GraphCast, Pangu-Weather, and FengWu achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like
WeatherBench-2, even outperforming traditional numerical weather prediction models (the ECMWF IFS). However, these models
have not been fully tested on real-world data collected from observing stations; rather the evaluation has focused on 
reanalysis datasets such as ERA5 that are generated by NWP models and thus include those models' biases and approximations.

WeatherReal is the first benchmark to provide comprehensive evaluation against observations from the 
[Integrated Surface Database (ISD)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/integrated-surface-database)
and the [Synoptic Data](https://www.synopticdata.com/) API, in addition to aggregated user-reported observations collected 
from Weather from Microsoft Start's weather platform. We provide these datasets separately and offer separate benchmark 
leaderboards for each, in addition to separating leaderboards by tasks such as short-term and medium-range forecasting. 
We also provide evaluation code that can be run on any model's predictions to generate scores for the benchmark. Note in
particular that by interpolating gridded forecasts to station locations, and using nearest-neighbor interpolation to
match point forecasts to station locations, we can fairly evaluate multiple forecast schemas.

### What WeatherReal is

- A benchmark dataset of quality-controlled weather observations spanning the year 2023, with future updates possible
- An evaluation framework to score many tasks for either grid-based or point-based forecasts

### What WeatherReal is not

- A dataset for training weather forecasting models
- An inference platform for running models
- An exclusive benchmark for weather forecasting
